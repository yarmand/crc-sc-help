## Board Document Library

The document library is where the board creates, collaborates on, and stores all its key documents — including **Finances**, **Operations**, and **Policies**.

[📂 Open the Board Document Library](https://crcscorg.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/BoardOfDirectors/Shared%20Documents/BOD-Shared-documents?csf=1&web=1&e=PFagqd){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank" }

- Browse folders to find meeting minutes, budgets, bylaws, and more.
- Upload new documents or edit existing ones directly in the browser — multiple people can work on the same file at once.

| Folder | Contents |
|:-------|:---------|
| Finances | Budgets, treasurer reports, audits |
| Operations | Meeting minutes, committee reports |
| Policies | Bylaws, policies, and procedures |
| Archives | Documents prior to our M365 migration (pre-2026) |
| **Meeting Agendas & Minutes** | Now located in the [Loop Workspace](docs/loop-workspace) — see the Board Life section |

## Board Life, Dashboards and Meeting Reports

This is our shared Loop workspace — the central hub for day-to-day board activity and tracking.

## Online Meetings

We use Microsoft Teams for all board meetings. Here's the quick rundown:

### Creating a meeting
1. Open [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) and go to **Calendar**.
2. Click **+ New meeting**.
3. Add a title, date/time, and invite attendees by name or email.
4. Click **Send** — attendees will receive a calendar invite with a join link.

### Starting the meeting and admitting attendees
1. When it's time, click **Join** from your calendar.
2. Choose your audio/video settings, then click **Join now**.
3. Attendees who aren't in the organization will appear in the **lobby** — click **Admit** to let them in.

### Transcript and meeting summary
1. During the meeting, click **⋯ (More)** → **Record and transcribe** → **Start transcription**.
2. After the meeting ends, the transcript is available in the meeting chat and in the meeting details on your calendar.
3. Use **Copilot** (in Teams) or **ChatGPT** to paste the transcript and ask for:
   - A **summary** of what was discussed.
   - A **list of follow-up tasks** with who is responsible.
