## Getting Started

1. Go to [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) or open the Teams desktop/mobile app.
2. Sign in with your CRC-SC account.
3. Click **Calendar** in the left sidebar — this is where you'll create and join all board meetings.

---

## Creating a Meeting

1. In the **Calendar** view, click **+ New meeting**.
2. Add a **title** (e.g., "CRC-SC Board Meeting — March 2026").
3. Set the **date and time**.
4. In the **Add attendees** field, type each board member's **email address**.

{: .note }
> Board members use guest accounts. Make sure to invite them using the email address associated with their guest account — they will receive a calendar invite with a join link.

5. Click **Send**.

## Starting the Meeting and Admitting Attendees

### As the organizer

1. When it's time, open your **Calendar** and click **Join** on the meeting.
2. Choose your audio and video settings, then click **Join now**.

### Admitting people from the lobby

Since board members are guest accounts, they will appear in the **lobby** when they try to join.

- You'll see a notification at the top of the meeting window: **"Someone is waiting in the lobby"**.
- Click **View lobby** to see who is waiting.
- Click **Admit** next to each person, or click **Admit all** to let everyone in at once.

{: .important }
> Only the meeting organizer (or a co-organizer) can admit people from the lobby. Make sure you've joined the meeting before the scheduled start time so attendees aren't kept waiting.

## During the Meeting

### Basic controls

| Control | How to use it |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Mute / Unmute** | Click the microphone icon in the meeting toolbar |
| **Camera on / off** | Click the camera icon |
| **Share screen** | Click the **Share** button (↑) and select your screen or a specific window |
| **Raise hand** | Click the **Raise hand** button to signal you'd like to speak |

### Starting a transcript

1. Click **⋯ (More)** in the meeting toolbar.
2. Select **Record and transcribe** → **Start transcription**.
3. The transcript runs in real time and captures who said what.

{: .note }
> You can also start a **recording** from the same menu if you want a video replay in addition to the transcript.

## After the Meeting

### Finding the transcript

Once the meeting ends, the transcript is available in two places:

- In the **meeting chat** in Teams.
- In the **meeting details** on your Calendar (click the meeting → scroll down).

### Getting a summary and follow-up tasks

Paste the transcript into **Copilot** (in Teams, if available) or **ChatGPT** and ask for:

- A **summary** of what was discussed.
- A **list of follow-up tasks** with who is responsible.

This is a quick way to produce meeting minutes and action items for the board.
