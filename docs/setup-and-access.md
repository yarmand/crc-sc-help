## Your Account Credentials

When you join the CRC-SC board, you'll receive a Microsoft 365 account:

- **Username**: `[REPLACE: e.g. yourname@crc-sc.org]`
- **Temporary password**: Provided by your IT contact

You'll be asked to change your password the first time you sign in.

## Signing In for the First Time

1. Go to [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com).
2. Enter your CRC-SC email address and click **Next**.
3. Enter the temporary password and click **Sign in**.
4. Follow the prompts to **set a new password**.
   - Use at least 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
5. You'll be redirected to the Microsoft 365 home page.

## Setting Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an extra layer of security to your account. You'll be prompted to set it up after your first sign-in.

1. Download the **Microsoft Authenticator** app on your phone:
   - [App Store (iPhone)](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)
   - [Google Play (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)
2. When prompted, open the Authenticator app and tap **+ Add account** → **Work or school account**.
3. Scan the QR code displayed on screen.
4. Approve the test notification to complete setup.

{: .important }
> Always keep the Authenticator app installed on your phone. You'll need it every time you sign in from a new device.

## Resetting Your Password

If you forget your password:

1. Go to [https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com).
2. Enter your CRC-SC email and complete the CAPTCHA.
3. Follow the steps to verify your identity (via Authenticator or email).
4. Choose a new password.

If self-service reset is not available, contact your CRC-SC IT contact for assistance.
