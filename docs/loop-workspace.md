## What Is Microsoft Loop?

Microsoft Loop is a collaborative tool that lets you create **workspaces** and **pages** where board members can work together in real time. Think of it as a shared notebook that everyone can edit simultaneously.

Key concepts:

| Term | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **Workspace** | A shared space for a project or team (e.g., "CRC-SC Board") |
| **Page** | A single document inside a workspace (e.g., "Feb 2026 Meeting Agenda") |
| **Component** | A reusable piece of content (table, task list, checklist) that can be embedded in Teams, Outlook, and other M365 apps |

## Accessing Loop

1. Go to [https://loop.microsoft.com](https://loop.microsoft.com).
2. Sign in with your CRC-SC account.
3. You'll see any workspaces that have been shared with you.

## Navigating Your Workspace

- **Left sidebar**: Lists all workspaces you belong to.
- Click a workspace to see its pages.
- Click a page to open and edit it.

## Creating a New Page

1. Open your workspace.
2. Click **+ New page** at the top or bottom of the page list.
3. Give the page a title (e.g., "March 2026 Action Items").
4. Start typing — other board members with access will see changes in real time.

## Using Loop Components

Loop components are interactive building blocks you can add to any page:

- **Task list**: Assign tasks to board members with due dates.
- **Table**: Organize information in rows and columns.
- **Checklist**: Track to-do items.
- **Voting table**: Collect quick votes or feedback.

To add a component:
1. Type `/` on a new line to open the component menu.
2. Select the type of component you want.
3. Fill it in — it's live and collaborative.

## Sharing Loop Pages and Components

You can share Loop pages or individual components with other board members:

1. Click the **Share** button at the top of a page, or hover over a component and click the **share** icon.

2. **Important**: Before sending, click the link settings and select **"Only people with existing access"**.

*Make sure to select "Only people with existing access" to avoid sharing beyond the board.*

3. Copy the link or enter the recipient's email and click **Send**.
4. Loop components can be **embedded** in Teams messages and Outlook emails — and they stay in sync everywhere.

{: .warning }
> Always verify the sharing option is set to **"Only people with existing access"**. This ensures pages and components are not accidentally shared with people outside the board.

## Tips for Board Use

- **Meeting agendas**: Create a Loop page for each meeting. Add a task list for action items.
- **Decision tracking**: Use a table component to log decisions, who made them, and when.
- **Async collaboration**: Board members in different time zones can contribute at their own pace.
