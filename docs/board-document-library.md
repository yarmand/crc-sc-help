## Accessing the Document Library

1. Go to your CRC-SC SharePoint site: `[REPLACE: e.g. https://crc-sc.sharepoint.com/sites/Board]`
2. Click **Documents** in the left sidebar.
3. You'll see folders organized by category (e.g., Meeting Minutes, Policies, Financial Reports).

{: .note }
> You can also access the document library directly from the **Files** tab in your Teams channel.

## Finding Documents

### Search

- Use the **search bar** at the top of the SharePoint site to find documents by name or content.
- You can filter results by date, author, or file type.

### Browse by Folder

Common folders you'll find:

| Folder | Contents |
|:-------|:---------|
| `[REPLACE: e.g. Meeting Minutes]` | Notes from board meetings |
| `[REPLACE: e.g. Policies]` | Bylaws, policies, and procedures |
| `[REPLACE: e.g. Financial Reports]` | Budgets, treasurer reports, audits |
| `[REPLACE: e.g. Strategic Plans]` | Long-term planning documents |

## Uploading Documents

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder.
2. Click **Upload** → **Files** (or drag and drop files into the browser window).
3. Wait for the upload to complete — you'll see a confirmation.

{: .important }
> **Naming convention**: Use descriptive names like `2026-01-Board-Meeting-Minutes.docx` rather than `doc1.docx`.

## Editing Documents

- Click any document to open it in the browser (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Online).
- Your changes are **saved automatically**.
- Multiple people can edit the same document at the same time.

## Version History

SharePoint keeps a history of every change:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to a file.
2. Select **Version history**.
3. You can view or restore any previous version.

## Sharing Documents

To share a document with someone outside the board:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to the file.
2. Select **Share**.
3. Enter the recipient's email and set permissions (View only or Edit).
4. Click **Send**.

{: .warning }
> Be cautious when sharing documents externally. When in doubt, check with your CRC-SC IT contact first.
