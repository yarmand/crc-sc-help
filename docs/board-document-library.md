## Accessing the Document Library

[📂 Open the Board Document Library](https://crcscorg.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/BoardOfDirectors/Shared%20Documents/BOD-Shared-documents?csf=1&web=1&e=PFagqd){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

1. Click the link above or go to the [Board of Directors SharePoint site](https://crcscorg.sharepoint.com/sites/BoardOfDirectors).
2. Click **Documents** in the left sidebar.
3. You'll see folders organized by category (e.g., Finances, Operations, Policies).

{: .note }
> You can also access the document library directly from the **Files** tab in your Teams channel.

## Finding Documents

### Search

- Use the **search bar** at the top of the SharePoint site to find documents by name or content.
- You can filter results by date, author, or file type.

### Browse by Folder

Common folders you'll find:

| Folder | Contents |
|:-------|:---------|
| Finances | Budgets, treasurer reports, audits |
| Operations | Meeting minutes, committee reports |
| Policies | Bylaws, policies, and procedures |
| Archives | Documents prior to our M365 migration (pre-2026) |
| **Meeting Agendas & Minutes** | Now located in the [Loop Workspace](loop-workspace) — see the Board Life section |

## Uploading Documents

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder.
2. Click **Upload** → **Files** (or drag and drop files into the browser window).
3. Wait for the upload to complete — you'll see a confirmation.

{: .important }
> **Naming convention**: Use descriptive names like `2026-01-Board-Meeting-Minutes.docx` rather than `doc1.docx`.

## Editing Documents

- Click any document to open it in the browser (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Online).
- Your changes are **saved automatically**.
- Multiple people can edit the same document at the same time.

## Version History

SharePoint keeps a history of every change:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to a file.
2. Select **Version history**.
3. You can view or restore any previous version.

## Sharing Documents

To share a document with someone outside the board:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to the file.
2. Select **Share**.
3. Enter the recipient's email and set permissions (View only or Edit).
4. Click **Send**.

{: .warning }
> Be cautious when sharing documents externally. When in doubt, check with your CRC-SC IT contact first.
