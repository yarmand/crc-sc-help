## Accessing the Document Library

[📂 Open the Board Document Library](https://crcscorg.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/BoardOfDirectors/Shared%20Documents/BOD-Shared-documents?csf=1&web=1&e=PFagqd){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank" }

1. Click the link above or go to the [Board of Directors SharePoint site](https://crcscorg.sharepoint.com/sites/BoardOfDirectors).
2. Click **Documents** in the left sidebar.
3. You'll see folders organized by category (e.g., Finances, Operations, Policies).

{: .note }
> You can also access the document library directly from the **Files** tab in your Teams channel.

## Finding Documents

### Search

- Use the **search bar** at the top of the SharePoint site to find documents by name or content.
- You can filter results by date, author, or file type.

### Browse by Folder

Common folders you'll find:

| Folder | Contents |
|:-------|:---------|
| Finances | Budgets, treasurer reports, audits |
| Operations | Meeting minutes, committee reports |
| Policies | Bylaws, policies, and procedures |
| Archives | Documents prior to our M365 migration (pre-2026) |
| **Meeting Agendas & Minutes** | Now located in the [Loop Workspace](loop-workspace) — see the Board Life section |

## Editing Documents

- Click any document to open it in the browser (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Online).
- Your changes are **saved automatically**.
- Multiple people can edit the same document at the same time.

## Commenting on Documents

You can leave comments directly in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint Online without editing the document itself:

1. **Select** the text or cell you want to comment on.
2. Right-click and choose **New comment** (or click the **Comment** button in the toolbar).
3. Type your comment and click **Post**.

- Other board members will see your comment and can **reply** or **resolve** it.
- Use **@mentions** (e.g., `@Jane Smith`) inside a comment to notify a specific person.

{: .note }
> Comments are a great way to suggest changes or ask questions without modifying the document content.

## Version History

SharePoint keeps a history of every change:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to a file.
2. Select **Version history**.
3. You can view or restore any previous version.

## Sharing Documents

To share a document link with another board member:

1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to the file.
2. Select **Share**.

![SharePoint Share dialog](/assets/images/share-dialog.png)
*The Share dialog in SharePoint — click the link settings to change who can access the file.*
{: .text-center }

3. **Important**: Before sending, click the link settings (the gear or pencil icon next to the link) and select **"Only people with existing access"**.

![Selecting the sharing permission](/assets/images/share-permissions.png)
*Make sure to select "Only people with existing access" to avoid sharing beyond the board.*

4. Copy the link or enter the recipient's email and click **Send**.

{: .warning }
> Always verify the sharing option is set to **"Only people with existing access"**. This ensures documents are not accidentally shared with people outside the board.
